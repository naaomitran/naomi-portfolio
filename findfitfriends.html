            <h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
            <h1>find fit friends</h1>
            <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
            <p>College provides many opportunities to meet new people and make friends, but post-college results in less proximity and busier schedules, making maintaining friendships harder (Patterson, 2021). Also, staying active is harder post-college due to time and stress from job hunting or working, especially during the transition from studying into a full-time job (Waehner, 2021). Thus, the human activity this system intends to support is to help early grads / young professionals find friends to participate in physical activities together. However, this system can be used by anyone over the age of 18 (due to the nature of online networking) wanting to do physical activity with others.</p>
            <h3>DESIGN DIRECTION</h3>
            <p>
                ðŸ“± Mobile app -> dating app x social media platform x calendar <br>
                ðŸ‘¥ For finding friends to engage in physical activity with and keep each other accountable<br>
                ðŸ—“ To help people coordinate physical activities with their friends

            <h4>TASK EXAMPLES</h4>
            <div class="grid-2">
                <div class="card">Sally has been in LA for a month as a software developer and itâ€™s her first job post-grad so the transition has been stressful. Her first month involved intensive training and non-stop coding, exhausting her by the time she gets home. Now, in the second month, Sally is more comfortable and wants to start getting  active. She is thinking of joining a spin class but doesnâ€™t know of any since she still isnâ€™t familiar with the area and she doesnâ€™t want to attend one alone. However, she doesnâ€™t have any girl friends around her age yet so she was hoping to find someone to join her and maybe make it a weekly thing to keep her active but also maintain a potentially good friendship. Sally can only attend a class on Tuesday at 4PM because she gets off work early or Saturday morning before 12PM. Finally, it would also be a bonus for Sally if this new friend lived near her so they could go on walks together and explore the city.</div>
                <div class="card">James and Hannah are new friends who both love playing tennis. The weather has recently cleared up in Vancouver so the two of want to play tennis together. James and Hannah donâ€™t have each otherâ€™s cellphone numbers so they will need to communicate via another channel. The two friends will need to decide on a time and place to play together. Both friends dislike the back and forth of dates and times that typically comes with organizing a meetup. Once the details of the meet up have been organized, both participants will input the details into their respective calendar apps. James uses iCal and Hannah uses Google Calendar. </div>

                <h3>DESIGN ALTERNATIVE 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by the general template of dating apps with an intended swipe feature. The message page is also inspired by general UI ways of encompassing messages. Finally, the feed is inspired by Instagramâ€™s feed page with a scrolling feature like most social media apps.
                        <br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Pros: </span>transfer knowledge from previous experiences 
                        <br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Cons: </span>Scheduling feature might not be intuitive, the organization of info for profile looks scattered (has to be fleshed out)

                <h3>DESIGN ALTERNATIVE 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by BeReal/IG - scroll through photos that were posted. Thereâ€™s a search function to find people / friends, and a profile page for a more social media-like feature. The schedule resembles a monthly calendar where users can add/remove events. Clicking on profiles takes them to the messaging page.
                        <br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Pros: </span>more community focused (users can message people they click on after viewing their profile instead having to add them as friends first)
                        <br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">Cons: </span>the remove and add event buttons may not be used as users may prefer directly adding and removing events after clicking on the specific date
